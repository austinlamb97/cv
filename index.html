  <p>I am a recent college graduate from <a href="https://www.avemaria.edu/">Ave Maria University</a> with a BA in Physics and
  minor in mathematics. During my time as a student, I have acquired a deep understanding of advanced mathematics, physics and
  chemistry and have developed skills in coding, complex problem solving, and intricate lab work in these subjects. My career
  goal is to find a position which utilizes my technical knowledge in programming as well as my knowledge of the natural sciences
  of physics and chemistry.</p>

  <strong>Proof of Theory: <a href="file:///C:/Users/Austin%20Lamb/Documents/cloaking.pdf">Optical Cloaking Using Metamaterials</a>
    | <em>Ave Maria University</em> | Fall 2018 Semester</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Derived wave equations for electromagnetic waves through mediums used in experiment</li>
      <li>Formatted a code in Matlab which gives reflective and transmittance coefficients for the given wave equations</li>
      <li>Created a model which demonstrates the destructive interference of the waves which successfully proves the capability of
          the cloaking device</li>
    </ul>
  <strong>Optimizing the Control of Engine Speed | <em>Ave Maria University</em> | Spring 2018 Semester</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Determined which parameters caused the most instability by evaluating the model of an engine given in Simulink</li>
      <li>Manipulated variables in PID controller system to reduce the amount of vibration and damping within the engine</li>
      <li>Utilized control system designer in Simulink to tune PID controller which successfully attained an engine model with most optimal efficiency
